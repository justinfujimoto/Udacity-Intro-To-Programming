<h3>Unit 1</h3>

	<p>HTML - HyperText Markup Language:</p>
	<p>The main type of document on the web</p>

	<p>Files Found on the Web:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Plain Text</li>

		<li>Images</li>
		<li>Videos</li>
		<li>Music</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Major Pieces</h5>
	<p>Browser - a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</p>
	<p>Internet - the world's largest computer network</p>
	<p>HTTP - the main protocol of the web</p>
	<p>Servers - computers that host the files that make up the web</p>

		<h1 class="container-heading">Part 2</h1>
		<p>In Part 2 you will use <b>HTML tags</b> to create a simple <b>HTML document</b><p> that a browser can display as a web page. </p>

	<h5>HTML</h5>
	<p>HyperText Markup Language<p>
	<p>HTML is made up of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Text content <b>what you see</b></li>
			<li>Markup <b>what it looks like e.g. images & videos</b></li>
			<li>References to other documents</li>
			<li>Links to other pages</li>
		</ul>

	<h5>HTML Tags</h5>
	<p>&lt;OpeningTag&gt;Contents&lt;/ClosingTag&gt;</p>
	<p>&lt;b&gt;contents&lt;/b&gt;<p>
	<p>b - bold</p>
	<p>&lt;em&gt;contents&lt;/em&gt;<p>
	<p>em - emphasis - <b>italics</b></p>

	<h5>Computers Are Stupid</h5>
	<p>Programmers often describe computers as "stupid."</p>
	<p>When they say this, they (usually) aren't insulting computers. They are addressing an important point about how computers understand the instructions that human programmers give them.</p>
	<p>In spoken languages, we can craft sentences with a great deal of <p>ambiguity</p>. Consider, for example, the sentence "Each of us saw her duck." Does that mean each of us saw her pet duck? Or did we each see her duck under something? Depending on the context, you might be able to infer which interpretation is correct.</p>
	<p>Computers can't make these inferences and so they interpret language literally. Computer programming languages are designed to limit ambiguity, but sometimes this can run into issues between the programmer and the machine.</p>
	<p>Keep this idea in mind as you watch the next video. Think about how sensitive computers are to typos and how small mistakes (mistakes that a "smart" human could easily correct) can lead to huge problems when given to a "stupid" computer.</p>

	<h5>HTML Attributes</h5>
	<p>&lt;tag attr="value"&gt;contents&lt;/tag&gt;</p>
	<p>Anchor - &lt;a&gt; - link</p>

	<h5>Images</h5>
	<p>&lt;img&gt;</p>
	<p>&lt;img src="url" alt="text"&gt;</p>
	<p>alt="text" is "required" - broken requests</p>
	<p>VOID tag - has no content, requires no closing tag</p>

	<h5>It's OK to Forget</h5>
	<p>You may be wondering why anchor tags use the href attribute while img tags use the src attribute. And you may become frustrated when (not if) you make the mistake of using one when you really need the other. Because when you make this mistake, your HTML will not work.</p>
	<p>So how will you ever remember details like this? Well... you don't have to!</p>
	<p>In fact, you may have already forgotten how to add links to HTML. That's fine. Unless you're writing HTML all the time, details like these aren't worth remembering. A Google search for "adding links in html" will always get you your answer.</p>
	<p>New programmers often struggle with this because in other learning environments it's often important that you remember a lot of facts. But programming doesn't work like that! There's just too many facts to remember them all. Instead, you need to understand a few big ideas and know how to get the details you need when you need them.</p>
	<p>When you do forget stuff, there's lots of resources to help you out. A Google search is usually helpful. Another great place is http://www.w3schools.com/, a website with lots of documentation on web development, including a huge reference guide of HTML tags. As you get more experience programming, the more you'll learn about all the amazing resources the web has for new and professional programmers.</p>

	<h5>Whitespace</h5>
	<p>&lt;br&gt; - break(void)</p>
	<p>&lt;b&gt; - paragraph</p>

	<h5>Inline vs Block</h5>
	<p>&lt;br&gt; - inline - ends line - new line - &lt;b&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;img&gt;</p>
	<p>&lt;p&gt; - block - makes invisible box around content - has height and width</p>

	<h5>Where to Focus</h5>
	<p>In the previous video Steve explained the distinction between <b>inline</b> and <b>block</b> elements. You might be a bit confused about the difference between the two, and that's okay. It's not necessary to understand everything right now and this topic will be revisited in the next lesson.</p>
	<p>In the next video you will have your first encounter with <b>container elements</b>: elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves. The purpose of these elements will not be clear yet, but in the next lesson you will see how these elements can be used to create web pages with complex structures.</p>

	<h5>Spam/Div</h5>
	<p>&lt;span&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; - inline</p>
	<p>&lt;div&gt;text&lt;/div&gt; - block</p>
	<p>Purpose - contain contents</p>

	<h5>HTML documents</h5>
	&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;<br>
	&lt;html&gt;<br>
	&lt;head&gt;<br>
	&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;<br>
	&lt;/head&gt;<br>
	&lt;body&gt;<br>
	&lt;b&gt;contents&lt;/b&gt;<br>
	&lt;/body&gt;<br>
	&lt;/html&gt;<br>

	<h5>HTML Document Structure</h5>
	<p>The concept of code strcuture will come up frequently thoughout this Nanodegree program. That's because programmers write code not just for computers, but for people as well. Writing code that people can easily read is a <b>VERY</b> important idea in computer programming. And a huge part of writing good code is structuring it well.</p>
	<p>If you've ever written an English essay, you're familiar with the purpose of indenting every paragraph. It's a visual marker that a new idea has begun. Indentation serves a similar purpose in writing code. Some languages have slightly different rules about proper indentation, but the concept is generally the same as in English - a new indent is a new idea.</p>
	<p>One big difference between indenting programming languages and indenting English, however, is that an indentation level persists throughout an idea. In HTML particularly, the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished.If this is a bit confusing, let's look at an example:</p>
		<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G2HYGHCzpf_m4x0ha2A-CCcMED8iAwAXn8DXNhr3udO7SViylh_1g0eJmUk702abXEWwfFBmm_mqthC9-Q=s0#w=1474&h=1066" alt="example">
			<ol>
				<li>The first line is something that should appear on every webpage you make. <!DOCTYPE html> defines the type of the document so the browser will render it correctly.</li>
				<li> The &lt;html&gt; tag opens our document. Everything that shows on the webpage is placed within this tag.</li>
				<li>The &lt;head&gt; tag defines metadata for our web page. This includes the title of the page (this is what appears in the top of your tab or browser window). Notice that the &lt;head&gt; tag is indented to a new level because the &lt;html&gt; tag was opened but not closed (a new idea was started but not completed). Moreso, the &lt;title&gt; tag is indented another level further (the &lt;head&gt; tag was opened but not closed).</li>
				<li>The &lt;title&gt; tag is closed on the same line it was opened which we usually do if the content of a tag is short. On the other hand, the &lt;head&gt; tag is closed on a different line. The closing tag is indented to the same level as the matching opening one.</li>
			</ol>
